On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and March 12 was declared a Black Thursday in the United States, giving in to the largest single day market crash since 1987. This was no coincidence. The pandemic had officially started crippling world economy. Stock Markets do not deal well with uncertainity, as history has often shown us, this was going to be one of the most uncertain periods of time mankind had seen. But not all has gone bad. Over the past 2 years of living with the pandemic, we as humans have grown and evolved, as we always do. Companies like Apple and Microsoft saw their all time highs during the pandemic while there were companies that went bankrupt and closed. So, what factored into these radical differences? What happened in the last 2 years that flourished some, while whitewashed others? In this project, we aim to solve this mystery. 1.1 Problem Statement Below are some of the formal questions we would be attempting to answer: Analysis of repetitive patterns in companies to understand the impact of annual events (Christmas, Halloween, Black Friday, etc.) and quarterly events (dates of SOFR announcement, quarterly earnings report, etc.) on different industries. Observe the people’s confidence in the stock market throughout COVID-19 by analyzing the behavior of stock fluctuations in various sectors of the economy (agriculture, healthcare, consumer good, electronics, technology, etc.) Superimpose that analysis to specific companies that were in the news for production of vaccines. Analyse the difference in performance of vaccine-producing pharmaceutical companies to other industries throughout COVID-19. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 R Packages for Scraping Finance Data 2.2 Structure of input Data", " Chapter 2 Data sources The primary focus of our project is to analyze the sentiment of the US Stock Market. This sentiment largely drives the prices of the stocks we will be analyzing throughout the project. The main sources of our data are Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg Finance. We have used this data in different forms throughout the project. At some places, we have downloaded the processed comma separated files provided by Yahoo Finance for historical data, while at times we have used R packages to directly scrap data from these web pages. The github repository page for this chapter contains the code used. Primary Data Sources: https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks https://finance.yahoo.com/ The CSV files we are using across this analysis are stored in the data folder of our repository. 2.1 R Packages for Scraping Finance Data 2.1.1 The getSymbols() Function getSymbols() is a CRAN package function available in Quantmod and is a wrapper to load data from various sources, local or remote. Current src methods available for the getSymbols function are: yahoo, google, MySQL, FRED, csv, RData, oanda, and av. In the example below we would show an example with Yahoo to capture data for Apple’s stock prices. Below is a sample of the data we get directly using the getSymbols() function for Apple. Table 2.1: Data from getSymbols date AAPL.Open AAPL.High AAPL.Low AAPL.Close AAPL.Volume AAPL.Adjusted 2021-03-01 123.75 127.930 122.79 127.79 116307892 127.1968 2021-03-02 128.41 128.720 125.01 125.12 102260945 124.5392 2021-03-03 124.81 125.710 121.84 122.06 112966340 121.4934 2021-03-04 121.75 123.600 118.62 120.13 178154975 119.5724 2021-03-05 120.98 121.935 117.57 121.42 153766601 120.8564 2021-03-08 120.93 121.000 116.21 116.36 154376610 115.8199 2.1.2 BatchGetSymbols() Function Another interesting methodology of capturing data for multiple stocks at once in the BatchGetSymbols() package, made available within the same CRAN package (BatchGetSymbols). It locally stores a downloaded cache of the ticker symbols we call the function with. This data can then be used for analysis locally in the same session. Once the session is reset, we would need to run the code again to rebuild the cache. After downloading the data, we can check the success of the process for each ticker. Notice that the last ticker does not exist in yahoo finance and therefore results in an error. All information regarding the download process is provided in the dataframe df.control: Table 2.2: Combined Data from BatchGetSymbol Function ticker src download.status total.obs perc.benchmark.dates threshold.decision FB yahoo OK 43 1.0000000 KEEP MMM yahoo OK 43 1.0000000 KEEP PETR4.SA yahoo OK 41 0.9302326 KEEP Moreover, this data can now easily be plotted and used for manipulation as well. Although this is a neat method to capture data for more then one ticker in the same function the cache functionality makes it difficult to use through multiple sessions. For this reason, we would not be using this method too often. But it is still handy, when one-time stock comparisons are needed (as shown above) 2.2 Structure of input Data Now, we will glance through the structure of the data we are going to be analyzing. Here, we have used a downloaded CSV file from Yahoo Finance that contains the same data fetched by the getSymbols() package. The downloaded CSV file can be found in the docs section. Table 2.3: Data from CSV download Date Open High Low Close Adj Close Volume 2021-09-07 15375.98 15403.44 15343.28 15374.33 15374.33 3967040000 2021-09-08 15360.35 15360.35 15206.61 15286.64 15286.64 4113530000 2021-09-09 15296.06 15352.38 15245.17 15248.25 15248.25 3997250000 2021-09-10 15332.92 15349.47 15111.31 15115.49 15115.49 4567980000 2021-09-13 15211.43 15215.44 15030.85 15105.58 15105.58 4701190000 2021-09-14 15168.45 15181.19 15008.30 15037.76 15037.76 4571950000 We observe that the structure of both data are the same. We would therefore, be using these interchangeably in different scenarios. Structurally, there are no further changes at this point needed to these data sources. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Additional Columns for calculating stock performance", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data will be using for this project is already preprocessed by Bloomberg and Yahoo to eliminate the following conditions. There are no missing or null values in the data. There are no typos, miss-spellings since the data is numeric and has no missing entries. Since date entries are supposed to be provided during data collection, there is no scope for excess data coming into the environment and hence we will not be dealing with cleaning excess data either. We will although, be adding additional columns to the dataset for calculation returns, sharpe ratio, correlation and moving averages. 3.1 Additional Columns for calculating stock performance "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Visualizing missing data points 4.2 Checking for Missing Values of stocks of Apple and Pfizer", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Visualizing missing data points Our project, the analysis of stock market data gathers data files from Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance. These are parts of highly processed and regularly maintained financial data on which thousands of people’s personal financing decisions rely. Therefore, there are no missing values found on these data sets. In the first section, I will use some historic stock data and run the missing plots function to check if there is any missing data. 4.2 Checking for Missing Values of stocks of Apple and Pfizer For the analysis below, we imported 3 years of stock data for AAPL and PFE. The output from these plots show us that the data we will be using for our analysis does not contain any missing values. Hence, we would be ending this section here prematurely, since there are no missing data points to analyse.

In the analysis below, we study about seven equity markets spread on the globe. FTSE (London, United Kingdom) - The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index, also called the FTSE 100 Index, FTSE 100, FTSE, or, informally, the “Footsie”, is a share index of the 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalisation. DAX (Frankfurt, Germany) - The DAX is a representation of the German (Frankfurt) Stock Exchange consisting majorly of the Bluechip organizations trading in Germany. FEZ (Europe on New York Stock Exchange) - The FEX equity holds European stocks on the NYSE. This is, therefore, a unique equity to understand since it functions on cross-market sentiments. 000001.SS - SSE Composite Index (Shanghai, China) - The SSE index is a representation of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and trades equities in the Chinese markets. IXIC - Nasdaq Composit (United States) - The Nasdaq Composite is a stock market index that includes almost all stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500, it is one of the three most-followed stock market indices in the United States. DJI (United States) - Dow Jones Industrial Average N225 - Nikkei (Tokyo, Japan) - The Nikkei 225, or the Nikkei Stock Average, more commonly called the Nikkei or the Nikkei index, is a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Key Observations from the analysis of Global Markets: Day Trade Patterns during the announcement of the Covid Outbreak and Vaccine Availability Let us now look at the trading prices of some diversified sectors of economy to understand if we see any important patterns of data. Key Observations from the analysis of Global Markets: 5.2 Behavioural Stock Price Analytics during COVID-19 ## Comparison of Vaccine Developing companies against others Pfizer (Ticker: PFE) BioNTech (Ticker: BNTX) Moderna (Ticker: MRNA) Johnson &amp; Johnson (Ticker: JNJ) Comparison against S&amp;P 500 (Ticker: ^GSPC) Dow Jones Industrial Average (Ticker: ^DJI) Nasdaq Composite (Ticker: ^IXIC) United Parcel Service (Ticker: UPS) Toyota Motor Corporation (Ticker: TM) Observations from the chart above: - Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson and BioNTech were the companies that announced their vaccine development programs early in 2021. - In the period from November 2020 to February 2021, we see a drastic volatility in two of those four stocks, namely, Moderna and BioNTech. - One anticipation for this result might be that BioNTech was actually co-developing the vaccine with Pfizer where Pfizer’s role was to meet with production demands. - Johnson &amp; Johnson was very late to the development and therefore, there is no volatility in it’s stock.

Keeping everything else aside, one thing is sure that the coronavirus pandemic raged through 2020 and continued throughout 2021 on the Stock Market. Our analysis showed that every market, every industry suffered significant losses throughout the pandemic. But, at the same time we also notice that some took this as an opportunity and bounced back to become better than ever. To conclude the analysis, let us answer the key questions we stated in the first part of our analysis: Analysis of repetitive patterns in companies to understand the impact of annual events (Christmas, Halloween, Black Friday, etc.) and quarterly events (dates of SOFR announcement, quarterly earnings report, etc.) on different industries. The general analysis of events that have been occurring for many many years is seen on the market, but it cannot be compared to what diversions something like a pandemic shows on the market. We noticed that there have been only 3 noted instances of market volatility of this margin, namely the great depression, the attacks of 9/11 and this pandemic. No other situation or event created such a downfall in the world economy. Observe the people’s confidence in the stock market throughout COVID-19 by analyzing the behavior of stock fluctuations in various sectors of the economy (agriculture, healthcare, consumer good, electronics, technology, etc.) We noticed that the start of the pandemic declaration was a situation of panic for the investors and it affected every business sector almost equivalently. This is understood, since the time was uncertain and investors were worried about sustainability of the future of all organizations. But with time we see that the confidence rises, starting with a noticeable steep in technology stocks. Another sector that saw a rise was sustainable energy and development. Superimpose that analysis to specific companies that were in the news for production of vaccines. Analyse the difference in performance of vaccine-producing pharmaceutical companies to other industries throughout COVID-19. Vaccination was an important update in tackling the affects of the pandemic. It was that glimmer of hope people saw come in as pharmaceutical companies announced their vaccine productions. Although, what might come as a surprise is that Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson (2 already very established and strong companies) did not benefit much from their vaccine announcements and productions. While on the other hand, BioNTech and Moderna showed very significant rise in their trade prices and trade volumes. 7.1 Future Directions and Potential Work Items While communicable diseases in general are not controllable to an extent, no one in their wild dreams would want to live through something like COVID-19 again. But, if this pandemic has taught us anything, it is the fact that we, humans, can overcome almost any adversity. So, it is important for the investors to keep their faith in the market. Having said that, in terms of the project enhancements, we propose the following work items that could be taken up at a future reference of time: Study the reasons for rise in sustainable energy promoting organizations like Tesla. Does a pandemic induce general appreciation for the environment in people’s minds? What happens when companies declare bankruptcy in situations like these? For instance, an organization like Jet Airways in the Asian market. What sector thrives with new IPOs, representing a rise in confidence from investors?
