On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and March 12 was declared a Black Thursday in the United States, giving in to the largest single day market crash since 1987. This was no coincidence. The pandemic had officially started crippling world economy. Stock Markets do not deal well with uncertainity, as history has often shown us, this was going to be one of the most uncertain periods of time mankind had seen. But not all has gone bad. Over the past 2 years of living with the pandemic, we as humans have grown and evolved, as we always do. Companies like Apple and Microsoft saw their all time highs during the pandemic while there were companies that went bankrupt and closed. So, what factored into these radical differences? What happened in the last 2 years that flourished some, while whitewashed others? In this project, we aim to solve this mystery. 1.1 Problem Statement Below are some of the formal questions we would be attempting to answer: Analysis of repetitive patterns in companies to understand the impact of annual events (Christmas, Halloween, Black Friday, etc.) and quarterly events (dates of SOFR announcement, quarterly earnings report, etc.) on different industries. Observe the people’s confidence in the stock market throughout COVID-19 by analyzing the behavior of stock fluctuations in various sectors of the economy (agriculture, healthcare, consumer good, electronics, technology, etc.) Superimpose that analysis to specific companies that were in the news for production of vaccines. Analyse the difference in performance of vaccine-producing pharmaceutical companies to other industries throughout COVID-19.

This sentiment largely drives the prices of the stocks we will be analyzing throughout the project. The main sources of our data are Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg Finance. We have used this data in different forms throughout the project. At some places, we have downloaded the processed comma separated files provided by Yahoo Finance for historical data, while at times we have used R packages to directly scrap data from these web pages. Primary Data Sources: https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks https://finance.yahoo.com/ 2.1 R Packages for Scraping Finance Data 2.1.1 The getSymbols() Function getSymbols() is a CRAN package function available in Quantmod and is a wrapper to load data from various sources, local or remote. Current src methods available for the getSymbols function are: yahoo, google, MySQL, FRED, csv, RData, oanda, and av. In the example below we would show an example with Yahoo to capture data for Apple’s stock prices. Below is a sample of the data we get directly using the getSymbols() function for Apple. Table 2.1: Data from getSymbols date AAPL.Open AAPL.High AAPL.Low AAPL.Close AAPL.Volume AAPL.Adjusted 2021-03-01 123.75 127.93 122.79 127.79 116307900 127.1968 2021-03-02 128.41 128.72 125.01 125.12 102260900 124.5392 2021-03-03 124.81 125.71 121.84 122.06 112966300 121.4934 2021-03-04 121.75 123.60 118.62 120.13 178155000 119.5724 2021-03-05 120.98 121.94 117.57 121.42 153766600 120.8564 2021-03-08 120.93 121.00 116.21 116.36 154376600 115.8199 2.1.2 BatchGetSymbols() Function Another interesting methodology of capturing data for multiple stocks at once in the BatchGetSymbols() package, made available within the same CRAN package (BatchGetSymbols). It locally stores a downloaded cache of the ticker symbols we call the function with. This data can then be used for analysis locally in the same session. Once the session is reset, we would need to run the code again to rebuild the cache. After downloading the data, we can check the success of the process for each ticker. Notice that the last ticker does not exist in yahoo finance and therefore results in an error. All information regarding the download process is provided in the dataframe df.control: Table 2.2: Combined Data from BatchGetSymbol Function ticker src download.status total.obs perc.benchmark.dates threshold.decision FB yahoo OK 42 1.0000000 KEEP MMM yahoo OK 42 1.0000000 KEEP PETR4.SA yahoo OK 40 0.9285714 KEEP Moreover, this data can now easily be plotted and used for manipulation as well. Although this is a neat method to capture data for more then one ticker in the same function the cache functionality makes it difficult to use through multiple sessions. For this reason, we would not be using this method too often. But it is still handy, when one-time stock comparisons are needed (as shown above) 2.2 Structure of input Data Now, we will glance through the structure of the data we are going to be analyzing. Here, we have used a downloaded CSV file from Yahoo Finance that contains the same data fetched by the getSymbols() package. The downloaded CSV file can be found in the docs section. Table 2.3: Data from CSV download Date Open High Low Close Adj Close Volume 2021-09-07 15375.98 15403.44 15343.28 15374.33 15374.33 3967040000 2021-09-08 15360.35 15360.35 15206.61 15286.64 15286.64 4113530000 2021-09-09 15296.06 15352.38 15245.17 15248.25 15248.25 3997250000 2021-09-10 15332.92 15349.47 15111.31 15115.49 15115.49 4567980000 2021-09-13 15211.43 15215.44 15030.85 15105.58 15105.58 4701190000 2021-09-14 15168.45 15181.19 15008.30 15037.76 15037.76 4571950000 We observe that the structure of both data are the same. We would therefore, be using these interchangeably in different scenarios. Structurally, there are no further changes at this point needed to these data sources.

These are parts of highly processed and regularly maintained financial data on which thousands of people’s personal financing decisions rely. Therefore, there are no missing values found on these data sets. In the first section, I will use some historic stock data and run the missing plots function to check if there is any missing data. 4.2 Checking for Missing Values of stocks of Apple and Pfizer For the analysis below, we imported 3 years of stock data for AAPL and PFE. The output from these plots show us that the data we will be using for our analysis does not contain any missing values. Hence, we would be ending this section here prematurely, since there are no missing data points to analyse.
