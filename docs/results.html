<p>Observations from the chart above:
- Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson and BioNTech were the companies that announced their vaccine development programs early in 2021.
- In the period from November 2020 to February 2021, we see a drastic volatility in two of those four stocks, namely, Moderna and BioNTech.
- One anticipation for this result might be that BioNTech was actually co-developing the vaccine with Pfizer where Pfizer’s role was to meet with production demands.
- Johnson &amp; Johnson was very late to the development and therefore, there is no volatility in it’s stock.</p>
